# The influence of probability magnitude on the noisiness of neural magnitude payoff representations

This is the project repo of the project by Dragan Rangelov, Gilles de Hollander, Christian Ruff, and Jason Mattingley

## Installation
To clone this repository and initialize the submodules, use the following commands:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Gilles86/prob_risk_noise.git
```

If you have already cloned the repository without initializing submodules, you can initialize them manually with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
